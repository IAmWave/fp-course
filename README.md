# Functional programming course assignments
My solution to the homework assignments from the functional programming course at Charles University
([NAIL097](https://is.cuni.cz/studium/predmety/index.php?do=predmet&kod=NAIL097), [the course's Github](https://github.com/vituscze/fp)).

As of now, there is an implementation of beta-reduction from lambda calculus. The implementation uses De Bruijn indices to represent lambda terms.

## Running tests
There are a couple of HUnit tests. Run them with
```
runghc TestLambda
```
